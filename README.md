# BINARY-CLASSIFICATION-ALGORITHMS-USED-TO-PREDICT-POVERTY


This project aims to compare the performance of several machine learning classification algorithms, in the task of predicting the poverty status of households in Nepal. 
The target variable to be predicted by each algorithm is a label “Poor" or “Non-Poor”. 
The algorithms are trained and predictions are evaluated Using national-level data from the Nepal Household survey 2011. 
The project does not aim to build a best possible model for poverty prediction but compares existing open source algorithms across multiple metrics.
